# Bond-Valuation-and-Fixed-Income-Risk-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and valuing a portfolio of corporate bonds using fundamental fixed-income concepts and real market data. The analysis evaluates individual bonds and the overall portfolio to understand pricing behavior, yield characteristics, and interest-rate risk.

The project includes detailed bond-level calculations such as clean and full prices, yield to maturity (YTM), modified duration, and convexity. Scenario analysis is performed to estimate bond price sensitivity under interest-rate changes (±100 basis points), highlighting how different maturities and coupon structures respond to market movements.

At the portfolio level, the project aggregates individual bond metrics to compute total portfolio value, weighted duration, and convexity. This enables assessment of overall interest-rate exposure and risk concentration across issuers and maturities.

The project demonstrates practical application of bond pricing theory, interest-rate risk management, and portfolio-level fixed-income analytics commonly used in investment management, treasury, and risk management roles.
